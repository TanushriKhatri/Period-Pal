# Period-Pal
<h3>Menstrual Tracking and Wellness Support Console-based App</h3>
<br>
This project aims to develop a console-based application, PeriodPal, that supports menstrual wellness by offering not only period tracking, but also mood updates, symptom recording, diet suggestions based on prakriti with respect to menstrual health, myth-busting content, and personalized interaction. The goal is to create a more approachable and interactive experience that shifts away from the traditionally serious tone associated with menstruation.
